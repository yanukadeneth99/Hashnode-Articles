# Understanding ADHD

The hallmark traits of ADHD for **inattention** and **distractibility**.

# Tips to Improve

1. **Create a Routine** - Try to follow the same schedule every day from wake up to bedtime.
    
2. **Develop Structure and Neat Habits** - To organize a room, home, or office, start by categorizing your objects, and deciding which are necessary and which can be stored or discarded.
    
    1. Create space - Ask yourself what you need on a daily basis, and find storage bins or closets for things you don't. Designate specific areas for things like keys, bills, and other items that can be easily misplaced. Throw away things you don't need.
        
    2. Use a Calendar app or day planner - This can help you remember appointments and deadlines.
        
    3. Use lists.
        
    4. Set aside daily time for organization - 5 to 10 mins to clear your desk.
        
3. **Deal with it now** - If a task can be done in two minutes or less, do it on the spot, rather than putting it off for later.
    
4. Follow the Process
    
    1. Getting Organized - Gets to where you need to be and gather the supplies needed to complete the tasks.
        
    2. Staying Focused - Learning to say “no” to distractions.
        
    3. Getting it Done - Finish up, checking work and putting final touches. Then cleaning up.
        
5. Prioritization
    
    1. Decide what to tackle first - Ask yourself what the most important task is that you need to accomplish, and then order your other priorities after that one.
        
    2. Take things one at a time.
        
    3. Again, learn to say no.
        
6. **Manage distractions** - Limit noise and have a clean environment. Music helps.
    
7. Limit choices - Make sure you create yourself only a few choices to select daily (ex: Clothes to wear, breakfast)
    
8. Be clear and specific when you talk
