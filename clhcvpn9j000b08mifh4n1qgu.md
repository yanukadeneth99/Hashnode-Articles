We'll be looking at a few tips I came across in some articles on how to recover Mentally. These are tips that I personally tried and worked on.

1. **Make sure you are taking care of your basic needs** - It doesn’t need to be always a priority, but as long as you take care of yourself. And they also help you to see that even if your worst fears come true, you’ll always have you.
    
2. **Start building a sense of safety in your relationships** - The goal is to be able to be your full, authentic self, and express yourself to these people. When you allow them to be there for you and to show you that you can open up and not be criticized or invalidated, you start to realize that not all relationships will crush or betray you, or end tragically.
    
3. **Learn to sit with your inner child and Soothe them** - When you get triggered, you feel threatened and unsafe. That’s your inner child screaming out for the nurturing and attention and love they never got. You have to learn to sit with and soothe yourself—to remind yourself: I am safe here, no matter what happens.  
      
    *Try having an internal conversation in your mind with a younger or previous version of yourself. Picture them clearly. Sit them down across from you and tell them all the things they never got to hear. Give them the validation, reassurance, and closure they never got. Breathe through the discomfort together and allow the emotions you’re experiencing to be present.*
    
4. **Integrate your trauma** - The process of emotional integration simply means looking at some of the most painful events that have ever happened to you and saying: “You know what? They made me stronger. You know what? They didn’t last. And you know what? They’re not all of me, they’re a part of me. It’s something I experienced, but it’s not who I am.”  
      
    *A final way to practice emotional integration is through letter writing. In my coaching program, I have my clients write letters of forgiveness. The first letter is to someone who hurt them and the second is to themselves. While they don’t send these letters, it helps them to express deeply repressed emotions and change their perspective on the key events that are still influencing them today.*
    
5. **Your fear and feelings are NOT facts** - Try to make sure that you see the positive or good things in your partner and relationship by proactively [practicing gratitude](https://www.crackliffe.com/words/2018/10/27/how-to-practice-gratitude-even-in-tough-times) and expressing appreciation for what they’ve done and continue to do for you. Unless you have evidence to prove that they are going to leave or have cheated, you’ve got to find a way to break your harmful beliefs.  
      
    *It’s also important that you start allowing whatever emotional experience you’re having to be present. In other words, lean into the discomfort and uncertainty. Accept that it’s what’s happening for you right now and that you don’t need to change it or push it aside. This is the paradox of feeling: the more you allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you’re feeling, the quicker it will actually pass.*
